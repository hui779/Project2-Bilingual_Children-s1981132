File "code-analysis" contains data set and all code of this project. The instructions are as follows.

## Data
We convert the original data set into csv file and save it as Rawdata.csv. File Data.Rda is the data set after imputation of missing values.

## Code
There are three Rmd files: raw-data-analysis.Rmd, PCA-regression-analysis.Rmd and task-type-analysis.Rmd. File raw-data-analysis.Rmd contains code of imputation and basic analysis of samples information, which corresponds to section 2 of our report. File PCA-regression-analysis.Rmd contains code of principal component analysis and regression models, corresponding to section 3 of report. File task-type-analysis.Rmd includes code of variance analysis between task types, and the correponding part of our report is section 4.
